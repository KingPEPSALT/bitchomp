# bitchomp

A rust library for reading in different types from a buffer of bytes.

## Disclaimer

This library is largely untested and currently unfinished. It will likely error
when pushed too far and breaking changes won't be uncommon. Beware!

bitchomp allows you read in arbitrary types, denoted `T: ByteReaderResource`
